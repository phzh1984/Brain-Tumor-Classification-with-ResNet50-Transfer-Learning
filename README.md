# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-ResNet50-Transfer-Learning

Overview

This repository contains code for a brain tumor classification model using transfer learning with ResNet50. The model aims to detect brain tumors from MRI scans, assisting in the identification of abnormal tissue growth in the brain or central spine.

About Brain Tumors

Brain tumors can disrupt proper brain function and are categorized based on the origin of tumor cells and their nature (benign or malignant). Primary tumors initiate within the brain, while secondary tumors spread from other areas, known as brain metastasis tumors. These tumors may present various symptoms, including headaches, seizures, vision problems, vomiting, and mental changes. Other symptoms such as difficulty in walking, speaking, or experiencing sensations may also manifest. As the disease progresses, unconsciousness may occur.

Dataset

The project utilizes the "Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection" dataset. This dataset consists of MRI scans categorized into two classes:

NO: Representing no tumor, encoded as 0

YES: Representing the presence of a tumor, encoded as 1
